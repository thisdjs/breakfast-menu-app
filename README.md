### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    If you haven't already, clone your repository to your local machine.

    # or
    # yarn install
    # or

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command will start the Vite development server, usually on `http://localhost:5173` (the port might vary if 5173 is in use).
    ```bash
    npm run dev
